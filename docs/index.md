## 🌍 The Paradigm Shift

Modern Geospatial analysis is no longer confined to desktop software. By adopting a **Code-First** approach, you unlock:

| Feature | Desktop GIS | Geospatial Coding |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Reproducibility** | Difficult to document mouse clicks | Scripted workflows (GitHub) |
| **Scalability** | Limited by PC hardware | Cloud-native processing (GEE) |
| **Automation** | Manual repetitive tasks | Batch processing of thousands of files |
| **Flexibility** | Fixed toolsets | Custom algorithms and ML integration |
