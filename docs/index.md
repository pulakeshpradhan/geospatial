# Geospatial Coding Hub

Welcome to the **Geospatial Coding Hub**. This site is dedicated to simplifying the world of geospatial analysis through code.

## 🌍 Why Geospatial Coding?

Traditional GIS is powerful, but coding allows for:

* **Automation**: Process thousands of images in seconds.
* **Reproducibility**: Share your workflows with others.
* **Scale**: Use cloud computing (like GEE) to analyze the whole planet.

## 🛠 Getting Started

We focus on the most essential tools in the industry:

1. **Python**: The language of choice for GIS.
2. **Geemap**: A Python package for interactive mapping with Google Earth Engine.
3. **GDAL/Fiona**: For handling vector and raster data.
